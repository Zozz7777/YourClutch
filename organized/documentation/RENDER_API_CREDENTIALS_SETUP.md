# Render API Credentials Setup Guide

## 🚨 **Critical Issue Identified**

The autonomous AI monitoring system is showing the warning: `"Render API credentials not configured"`

This prevents the AI agent from accessing Render logs for comprehensive monitoring and issue detection.

## 🔧 **Required Environment Variables**

You need to configure these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

### 1. **RENDER_API_KEY**
- **Purpose**: Authenticates the AI monitoring agent with Render's API
- **How to get it**:
  1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
  2. Click on your account settings (top right)
  3. Go to "API Keys" section
  4. Create a new API key or use existing one
  5. Copy the API key value

### 2. **RENDER_SERVICE_ID**
- **Purpose**: Identifies which Render service to monitor
- **Value**: `clutch-main-nk7x` (your backend service name)
- **How to find it**:
  1. Go to your service in Render dashboard
  2. The service ID is in the URL: `https://dashboard.render.com/service/[SERVICE_ID]`
  3. Or check the service settings

## 📋 **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Access Render Dashboard
1. Go to [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Navigate to your `clutch-main-nk7x` service

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables
1. Click on "Environment" tab in your service
2. Add these environment variables:

```
RENDER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
RENDER_SERVICE_ID=clutch-main-nk7x
```

### Step 3: Deploy Changes
1. Click "Save Changes"
2. The service will automatically redeploy
3. Monitor the logs to confirm the warning disappears

## ✅ **Verification**

After setting up the credentials, you should see:

1. **No more warnings** about "Render API credentials not configured"
2. **Enhanced monitoring** in the AI agent logs
3. **Render log integration** in the autonomous system

## 🔍 **What This Enables**

With Render API credentials configured, the AI monitoring agent can:

- ✅ **Monitor Render logs** in real-time
- ✅ **Detect deployment issues** from Render's perspective
- ✅ **Access service metrics** and performance data
- ✅ **Get comprehensive system health** information
- ✅ **Enable full autonomous monitoring** capabilities

## 🚨 **Security Note**

- Keep your `RENDER_API_KEY` secure
- Don't commit it to version control
- Only share with trusted team members
- Rotate the key periodically

## 📊 **Expected Log Output**

After configuration, you should see logs like:
```
✅ Render API credentials configured
🔍 Checking Render logs for issues...
📊 Render service health: healthy
```

Instead of:
```
⚠️ Render API credentials not configured
```

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

If you still see the warning after configuration:

1. **Verify the API key** is correct and has proper permissions
2. **Check the service ID** matches exactly: `clutch-main-nk7x`
3. **Restart the service** to reload environment variables
4. **Check Render API limits** - ensure you haven't exceeded rate limits

**Status**: ⚠️ **Action Required** - Configure Render API credentials to enable full autonomous monitoring capabilities.
