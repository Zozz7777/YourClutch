# üß† **AUTONOMOUS FRONT-END MASTER PLAN**
## *The Evolution to a Fully Self-Sufficient Digital Organism*

---

## üéØ **VISION STATEMENT**

We are creating a paradigm shift from traditional software development to a fully autonomous, intelligent entity. This is not about assisting human developers, but about transforming the entire front-end development life cycle into a self-sufficient, self-healing system that operates with zero-touch intervention.

**The human role shifts from building and fixing to oversight and strategic guidance.**
