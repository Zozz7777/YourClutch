# Cursor Rules for Clutch Platform

## Frontend Enforcement Rule

All frontend work on the Clutch platform must strictly follow design.json.

design.json is the single source of truth for all design decisions (layout, components, colors, spacing, typography, responsiveness).

You must never edit or modify design.json directly.

You must never override, ignore, or approximate its specifications â€” pixel-perfect adherence is required.

If a design detail is unclear, default to what is defined in design.json rather than inventing new styles.

Backend and logic code may be changed freely, but all UI must remain fully consistent with design.json.

This rule is permanent and applies to all current and future frontend tasks across login, dashboard, users, fleet, finance, and every other Clutch page.

## Development Standards

### No Temporary Fixes
Only implement permanent solutions. No temporary workarounds, placeholder code, or quick fixes that will need to be replaced later.

### Production-Ready Code Only
All code must be production-ready from the start. No mock data, dummy data, or test data in production code. Use real data sources and proper error handling.
