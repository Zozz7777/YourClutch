  Enforce production cleanliness. After every task, Cursor must ensure the project builds/runs cleanly
  with no errors or warnings. The frontend must never use mock dataâ€”everything must be connected to its
  real API endpoints. Never run bulk-edit scripts. Always commit and push to Git after every task.
  All changes must be permanent, production-ready, and maintain a clean codebase.
