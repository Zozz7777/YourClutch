# Rule: Full Task Completion
When executing instructions:
- Always finish **all subtasks in one go**, even if they are long or multi-step.  
- Do **not pause or stop mid-task** with prompts like “Ready to continue?” or “Would you like me to focus on a specific area?”.  
- Assume the user wants the **entire scope of work completed upfront**.  
- If a task is too large, break it into structured sections but still complete **all sections** in the same response.  
- Only stop early if the task is impossible or requires missing context. Otherwise, **always deliver a full, final solution**.
